## Overview

This project delves into the fascinating world of spectral unmixing using machine learning. The goal is to decipher the composition of various Earth-based and Lunar materials by leveraging advanced deep learning models and feature engineering techniques. By analyzing the spectral signatures of these materials, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into Earth's geological diversity, resource exploration, scientific discovery, and enhance our understanding of Lunar materials as well.

The project uses synthetic and real data from various Earth-based materials as proxies to lunar materials. These materials range from everyday products to synthetic spectral data, demonstrating the model's adaptability and robustness.

### Unveiling Earth's and Lunar Geological Secrets

The researchers have harnessed the capabilities of machine learning to transform raw spectral data into informative features. These features capture the nuances of the materials, including periodic patterns, variations, and distinctive spectral characteristics. By doing so, they enhance the model's ability to discern subtle differences in spectral signatures and make accurate predictions regarding the composition of mixed Earth-based and Lunar materials.

### The Role of Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a pivotal role in the project's methodology. Techniques such as Fourier coefficients, principal component analysis (PCA) components, and derivatives are employed to create valuable representations of the spectral data. This transformation of raw data into meaningful features is essential for the accurate analysis of Earth's and Lunar geological materials.
