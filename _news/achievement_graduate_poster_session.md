### About the Research

In this project, I focused on developing an interesting method for spectral deconvolution using machine learning techniques. Spectral deconvolution is a crucial process in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, material science, and environmental science. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, I aimed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of determining material compositions in mixed samples.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the University of Alabama in Huntsville for organizing the Graduate Poster Session and providing a platform to showcase our research endeavors. I am also thankful to the faculty judges for their valuable feedback and recognition of my work.

### Future Directions

Moving forward, I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of machine learning and spectroscopy to address complex scientific challenges. I am committed to advancing knowledge and making meaningful contributions to the scientific community.

Once again, thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journey. I am honored to have received this recognition and look forward to future opportunities for research and collaboration.
